I think these notes are super useful for people who are new to rings, groups etc. We wrote these notes during the program. I am hoping that anyone who has taken 1st year linear algebra courses should be able to understand these notes. Liam is actually a super cool grad student and mentored Amelie and myself during the program. I ended up giving a talk about the Wedderburn-Artin structure theorem of semisimple (Artinian) ring in front of a bunch of other people in the Faculty of Mathematics at the University of Waterloo. (yes, it was scary lol)
